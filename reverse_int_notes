How to Reverse an Int in Python

There are a couple of ways to do this without converting Int to Str

1. While Loop
2. Recursion

While Loop Algorithm
    # Logic
(1) Initialize variable reverse = 0
(2) Loop While number > 0:
    (2a) remainder = 100 % 10
    (2b) reverse = (reverse * 10) + remainder
    (2c) x = x // 10
return reverse
